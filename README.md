- 👋 Hi, I’m @eni-awowale
- 👀 I’m interested in Geospatial Ecology, quantitative data analysis and data management. I am passionate about using Python to optimize extracting ecological information from remotely sensed images. I enjoy making data visualizations with Matplotlib and using Python to make maps.
- 🌱 I primarily code in Python but know R, Java, JavaScript, and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on geospatial data collection and extraction projects specifically those with environmental applications.
